Assumption on target folder structure:
Windows [WIN]:
D:\Development\project\casino

Mac [OSX]:
/Development/project/casino

Required tools (already built-in on OSX, just need to install and configure on WIN):
command line svn
command line git

Build resources: Do in WIN
1. svn co clean casino project to target
2. cd to D:\Development\project\casino\client\examples\SlotMachine\build
3. run: ./build.sh pre-dev release ios en_us (or other configuration, but it has to be release, as we need to compress texture and upload to cdn)
-. this step will build the local assets and put it in a newly created directory: D:\Development\project\casino\client\examples\SlotMachine\proj.ios\ios_resources
-. the local assets in ios_resources is also uploaded to gitlab in: http://10.6.0.253/casinodeluxe/ios_resources.git (we need to pull it later in OSX)

Build iOS binary: Do in OSX
The entire build pipeline (xcode archive + upload to iTunes connect) is done in /Development/project/casino/client/docs/hakim/tools/builder/just-build-main.sh
(The builder-main.sh variation can even automatically pull the latest version for you, if you are using git-svn, but if you are not, stick with the just-build-main.sh)
1. checkout the ios_resources project to /Development/project/casino/client/examples/SlotMachine/proj.ios/ios_resources
2. open up the main xcode project located in /Development/project/casino/client/examples/SlotMachine/proj.ios/CasinoByIGG.xcodeproj
3. make sure that everything under ios_resources are added as Folder Reference to Resources folder in xcode
4. check and make sure all the source codes are sync-ed to the xcode project, as deleted files and/or new files not yet added to the xcodeproj will cause errors which will only be shown at the end of the build (very long time, really)
5. skip this step if you are using git-svn and/or running the builder-main.sh as it will automatically do this for you
-. make sure the "Bundle Version" in info.plist is incremented and not lower than the current one iTunes Connect (failing to do this will cause archive rejected by Apple)
-. open up just-build-main.sh and comment out "sh setup-casino-bundle-version.sh"
6. run just-build-main.sh
-. as it is going to take very long time, to avoid missing on any important output, you can do this:
-. cd /Development/project
-. sh ./casino/client/docs/hakim/tools/builder/just-build-main.sh > build_output.log
-. tail -f build_output.log
-. wait for the iTunes Connect notification :)
